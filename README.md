## Proposal
As a team we decided to create our own project. A website where employees can make a 'post' and where employers can make an offer. An employee could sell himself with a personalized profile and the same applies for the employers. 
It is also possible for employers to place a 'post' and employees can respond to this. A direct chat system can be used here so that faster contact is possible.
